%h1 Welcome to SemanticTweet

%p<
  To see your twitter friends and followers as a
  = succeed ',' do
    %a{:href => "http://www.foaf-project.org/"} FOAF document
  enter your twitter screen name:

%form{:action => '/screen_name', :method => 'get'}
  %label http://twitter.com/
  %input{:type => "text", :id => "screen_name", :name => "screen_name" }
  %input{:type => "submit", :value => "Go" }

%p Status: if there was a letter before alpha, it would be that.

%p
  Why is this useful? Well, for one, instead of having to hand-craft your FOAF file, or use a service such as
  = succeed ',' do
    %a{:href => 'http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic'} FOAF-a-matic
  you can now embed a reference to this service directly in your homepage, blog, or whatever, without ever needing to upload or update any files.

%p
  To do so, just add the following line to the
  %code <head>
  section of your webpage:

%code
  <link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF" href="http://semantictweet.com/your-twitter-screen-name" />
